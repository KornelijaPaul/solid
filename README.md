# SOLID Principles

- Single Responsibility Principle

This states that __a class should have a single responsibility__, but more than that, __a class should only have one reason to change__.

- Open Closed Principle

Classes should be __open for extension, but closed for modification__.

- Liskov Substitution Principle

Objects should be __replaceable by their subtypes__ without altering how the program works.

- Interface Segregation Principle

Classes should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use.

- Dependency Inversion Principle

Classes should __depend upon abstractions, not concretions__.
